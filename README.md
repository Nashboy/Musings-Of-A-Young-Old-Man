# Musings-Of-A-Young-Old-Man
This is a Personal Project to put together all the concepts I learned into one webpage.
Everything I learned has been with the intent to build a personal philosophy, worldview, ethic, and theory of everything.
It will be a slow and progressive build towards the full model and will later be used as a means of putting out my thoughts
and giving a quick reference page for anyone curious about the ideas.

I will later link a Youtube Channel and other Socials when I feel it relevent but for now, enjoy this rough draft
